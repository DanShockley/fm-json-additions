Extra functions for working with JSON in FileMaker. These use on the new native functions in FM 16. Each function has tests for correctness.

## Using

## Contributing

We love contributions and bug reports. Please report them in the Issues. We'll try to address anything that comes up as soon as we can.

Your contributions and bug reports, and fixes will be about 20 times more likely to be included or addressed if you include a copy of the FM Test file with Tests for your new feature or bug report. We won't release anything with out Tests so getting the tests up front makes a huge difference.
